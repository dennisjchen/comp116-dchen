Assignment 5
Alex Polyakov and Dennis Chen

Part 1

There is an additional image embedded in Image A, titled "prado.jpg", of Norman Ramsey.

To find it, we did

steghide extract -sf [ImageAFilename]

with no passphrase, and steghide dropped it in the directory we ran it from. Using this technique
on the other two images revealed no embedded content.

Part 2
1. Win95 FAT32 and Linux(0x83)
2. No
3. Linux-Debian: Kali Linux 1.0. To find this, we used Autopsy and extracted the debian_version file from etc.
4. Metasploit because there are a lot of pictures and files relating to the metasploit framework. The pictures also indicate that it was being used. There is also wireshark, ghostscript, postgres, and subversion and these can be found in the etc folder.
5. Yes there is a root password, it is: toor
6. We think there are not any other human users, but passwd shows possibilities of other entities.
7. Lots of pictures of the celebrity to be stalked.
8. Yes, the suspect's .bash-history in /root shows several commands to rm -rf Documents and rm -rf Pictures, as well as some files that were posisbly incriminating
9. Yes there are encrypted files, but we could not obtain the contents because they are encrypted. There are a lot of deleted files that cannot be extracted.
10. Yes! 07/28/2012 at The Colosseum At Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, NV. It can be found in the ticket information that is a PDF. Ordered by mchow01@gmail.com for $113.70.
11. Theres really weird pictures like raw meat, woman in a ball gag, profile of some random guy. Also some of the file creation dates date to the unix epoch, this shows that they might have been tampered with.
12. Celine Dion
